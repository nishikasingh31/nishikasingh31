## 🎯 About Me  
- I’m currently building full-stack applications using React on the front end, Node.js/Express on the back end, and working with Python for machine learning/AI projects.  
- I’ve worked on projects such as a **Handwritten Digit Classification using CNN**, and a **Multilingual Language Detection & Translation System**.  
- I’m passionate about turning ideas into code and creating tools that people can use.  
- Always learning and exploring: new JS frameworks, ML libraries, cloud tech, and more.
